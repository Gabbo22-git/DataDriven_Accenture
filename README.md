This repository contains an analysis of restaurant data in the United States, collected through web scraping using the Yelp Fusion API. 
The project was developed for Accenture, aiming to define a go-to-market strategy based on data analysis. 
The data extraction process is documented in the Italian_rest_NY.ipynb file, where various restaurant categories were scraped, followed by an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and some general geographic visualizations. 
The raw dataset, stored in Scraped Data Set.csv, contains a wide range of information, but many of these details were not necessary for the final analysis. 
Therefore, the clean_data.ipynb file was used to filter and clean the dataset, resulting in the final Scraped_Data_Cleaned_Filtered.csv file. 
The definitive analysis was then performed in DATA_ANALYSIS_G.ipynb, incorporating insights to support the go-to-market strategy.
